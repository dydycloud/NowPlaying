Consume the In Theaters API service from Rotten Tomatoes to generate a dynamic list of the films currently showing along with their details and ratings.

Utilizes
---------

* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)


Installation and Execution
---------------------------

1. `git clone https://github.com/kylebuch8/NowPlaying.git`
2. `bower install & npm install`
3. `grunt server`

This should get your copy up and running. If you run into errors along the way, like I did, make sure you own all the necessary directories and can access the git protocol.
